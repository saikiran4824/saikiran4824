## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a passionate and detail-oriented **Frontend Developer** with extensive experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications using the latest technologies. I specialize in **React.js** and the **MERN Stack**, with a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end development.

I enjoy working on **React**, leveraging **Redux** for state management and using **TypeScript** for type safety in large-scale applications. I’m committed to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code and continuously striving to improve the user experience with modern frontend libraries and frameworks.
