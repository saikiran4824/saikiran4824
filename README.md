## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a passionate and detail-oriented Frontend Developer with extensive experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications using cutting-edge technologies. I specialize in React.js, AngularJS, and the MERN & MEAN stacks, with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development.

With expertise in React and state management using Redux, I focus on creating scalable and maintainable solutions for modern web applications. I also leverage TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance developer productivity in large-scale projects. My experience extends to AngularJS for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) and integrating with various back-end services.

I am well-versed in using JavaScript (ES6/ES7), Node.js, Express, and MongoDB in the context of both the MERN and MEAN stacks, which enables me to work on full-stack development with an emphasis on efficient, high-performance solutions. My commitment to writing clean, modular, and maintainable code is coupled with a strong focus on optimizing user experience and staying current with the latest frontend frameworks and best practices.
